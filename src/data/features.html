          <h2>Manjaro 0.8.8-pre0</h2>
          <p>I'm really happy with our current stable release. We passed already the two year mark. From zero to hero. Here are some facts:</p>

          <p><strong>2011-07-10 07:55:58</strong> - Roland Singer announced a new project called <strong>Manjaro Linux</strong> at the <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=959229#p959229">Archlinux forum</a>
<br>
<blockquote><i>Hi all,
<br>
I am working now since a longer time on my arch linux livecd. It is called manjaro linux and uses the Desktop Environment Xfce. I uploaded a first testing livecd which is very experimental and many features are still missing. I would be thankful for any bugs reported,.... or if somebody wants to help and join the project he is always welcome. - Roland Singer (ying)</i></blockquote>
          </p>
          <p><strong>2011-07-15 10:06:00</strong> - First public release - based on Archlinux
          <ul class="icons clean"><li><i class="icon-check"></i><a href="http://www.taringa.net/posts/linux/14090573/Manjaro-Linux-Un-liveCD-basado-en-ArchLinux.html">0.1.1</a> by Roland Singer & Guillaume Benoit</li></ul>
          </p>
          <p><strong>2012-08-20 14:25:00</strong>
 - First public release - forked from <a href="http://blog.manjaro.org/2012/08/20/finally-manjaro-xfce-edition-is-released/">Archlinux</a>
          <ul class="icons clean"><li><i class="icon-check"></i>0.8.0 by Philip Mueller, Roland Singer & Guillaume Benoit</li></ul>
          <blockquote><i>We kept the public mostly in the dark. Some might thought that we are dead or something else. This was necessary to create our new distribution-framework. Currently we have one root-server hosting our main-repository and all our development tools and blog. Four official Manjaro Linux mirrors supply you guys with all our fresh packages, which are tested snapshots of Archlinux with our own packages in the mix. This means we are 100% compatible to Arch-Linux but yet standing on our own feet. Using AUR-repository is possible. - Philip Mueller</i></blockquote></p>
          <p>Mate, what a ride !!! We don't need gravity here in the afterglow ...</p>

          <p>So we don't stop here. Manjaro 0.8.8 will come next and I'm happy to present to you our first early preview. This build is based on our <strong><i>unstable branch</i></strong>, so only people who want to experiment should use this install media.</p>

          <p>Some facts about the current changes:</p>

          <p><strong>Live-Installer</strong><ul class="icons clean">
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Lot of coding improvements</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Hide advanced settings (use your own mounted partitions) and only make that available when started with the --advanced parameter.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Skip HDD selection if only one HDD is listed.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Explanatory text for partition selection.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Integrate Plymouth support</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>When grub is de-selected: de-select Plymouth and vise versa.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Detect Win8 partitions.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Show Plymouth selection in overview.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Force unmount on /target.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Catch dollar sign in password field.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Password with special character bug fixed</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Fix crashes transfering content to target</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Use more stock buttons</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p><strong>ManjaroISO</strong><ul class="icons clean">
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>use unstable branch</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>add plymouth</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>use linux310 (linux311 not ready yet for aufs)</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>Test this install media and try to beak it. For suggestions we are always open. Give us your feedback so Manjaro 0.8.8 will be even better than every release we did before!</p>

          <h2>But wait, there's more ...</h2>
          <p>Manjaro shares many of the same features as Arch<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>, including:

          <ul class="icons clean">
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Speed, power, and efficiency</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Access to the very latest cutting and bleeding edge software</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>A 'rolling release' development model that provides the most up-to-date system possible without the need to install new versions, and</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Access to the Arch<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> User Repository (AUR).</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>However, Manjaro boasts a few extra features of its own, including:

          <ul class="icons clean">
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>A simplifed, <b>user-friendly installation process</b></li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Automatic detection</b> of your computer's <b>hardware</b> (e.g. graphics cards)</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Automatic installation of</b> the necessary <b>software</b> (e.g. graphics drivers) for your system</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Its <b>own dedicated software repositories</b> to ensure delivery of fully tested and stable software packages, and</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Support for the easy installation and use of <b>multiple kernels</b>.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Pamac</b> makes it easy for you to install additional software and manage your applications.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Octopi</b> is our alternative frontend for pacman and yaourt. With its simple gui it is easy to maintain your packages.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Manjaro Settings</b> a collection of graphical user interfaces to manage your keyboard, translation packages, hardware and user accounts.</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>ManjaroISO</b> enables you to respin Manjaro as you might like it. You can add any supported software to your own compilation and share it with our community.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Desktop Environments</h2>

          <p>There are several Desktop Environments and Window Managers available for Manjaro, each with their own unique style, interface, and features. Furthermore, it is possible to install multiple environments if desired, which can be selected at the login screen at any time. Users are not resitricted to whatever comes pre-installed with a particular flavour of Manjaro.</p>

          <p>How to install additional Desktop Environments is documented in our <a href="http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Install_Desktop_Environments">wiki</a>.</p>

          <h3>XFCE 4.10</h3>
          <p>Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly. Refer to the <a href="cmd://link?http://www.xfce.org/about/news/?post=1335571200">XFCE 4.10 Release Notes</a> for more details.</p>

          <h3>Openbox 3.5</h3>
          <p>Openbox is a highly configurable window manager. It allows you to change almost every aspect of how you interact with your desktop and invent completely new ways to use and control it. It can be like a video game for controlling windows. But Openbox can also be kept extremely simple, as it is in the default setup, meaning that it can suit just about anybody. Openbox gives you control without making you do everything. Refer to the <a href="cmd://link?http://openbox.org/">Openbox homepage</a> for more details.</p>
